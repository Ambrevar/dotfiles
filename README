Synopsis
********
This repository contains configuration files for various Unix-programs.

Target distribution: Arch Linux (might work for most Unices as well)

Generic Comments
****************

The only purpose is to be a source of inspiration. Examples are always a good
technical support. (Especially for applications that do not provide examples in
their documentation.)  There is no use in blind-copying the content of any file
into your personal home folder. At best it might break things.

In case you still want to copy some files -- for quick genuine testing purpose
-- do not forget that most of the files are in hidden folders.  Also note that
in some shells, the '*' joker will NOT match hidden files, that is

        cp -r source-dir/* dest-dir/

will copy non-hidden folders only.  To match all folders, use the following
joker instead:

        cp -r source-dir/.??* dest-dir/

Some applications will need extra dependencies other than the default ones. You
might have a look at the .arch-pkg-explicit* files to see what software I've
been using.

Final word: do not forget to read the manpages!

Awesome
*******
Extra deps: Vicious

Configuration is very close to the default one, which mostly fits my needs.
Most of the work I've done is for the status bar, but since I'm using the
Vicious plugin, it is quite straightforward.

Emacs
*****
Extra deps: auctex, auto-complete, emacs-lua-mode, emacs-yasnippet,
emacs-yasnippet-latex-git

Not much personal work, mostly use of plugins. Still very powerful.

Luakit
******
Some custom bindings, download location, search engines, etc.
Functional Adblock script.

Mutt
****
This one is not easy to get into it. I managed to get multiple accounts with
pgp-encrypted passwords working, which means there is no plain password stored
on the disk. As a result, I just get prompted for a main password on mutt
startup, then everything works out of the box.

For now, I'm using mutt-smtp for Gmail accounts and msmtp for other
accounts. Both work fine with gpg.

Ranger
******
Custom bindings, file association, tweaked a few options.

Scripts
*******
.save: generates a home configuration archive.
.network: network setup. Works with wpa_supplicant. May replace any network
          manager.

Shell
*****
Target: zsh, bash

Probably the most interesting part here. A lot of stuff: aliases, functions,
shell options, etc.

Please note that this config is mainly intended -- and tested -- for zsh. It
should be mostly bash-compatible though.  When incompabilities have been
encountered, it has been reported into the configuration files. Hence the shared
folder .shell.d/, whose files get sourced by both bash and zsh.  Bash-specific
and zsh-specific options are in dedicated files ending with the apropriate shell
name.

Vim
***
I've only been a casual Vim user, so do not expect to much from it.

WMFS
****
The last time I used WMFS, the development was in a transition from version 1.x
to 2.x. So beware!, configuration files might be quite broken.
