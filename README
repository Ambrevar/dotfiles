Synopsis
********

This repository contains scripts configuration files for various Unix
programs. It targets Arch Linux and FreeBSD (might work for most
Unices as well).

################################################################################

Highlights
**********

* Smart audio transcoding: implemented as shell functions. It will convert, tag
  and move the input tracks in a dynamic, yet customizable manner. It features a
  smart title case AWK function that will print almost any audio tag the proper
  way. It will copy cover files when found. You can preview the changes without
  writing data. Using FFmpeg.

* Video transcoding: batch conversion of any kind of videos. Using FFmpeg.

* Plain TeX: partial unicode support (borrowed from LaTeX).

* Emacs LaTeX home-made environment, dynamic compilation, custom variable
  support, SyncTeX working with Zathura, PDF compression, and much more.

* Mutt Sidebar with multiple account on non-local IMAP (using Mutt's IMAP
  client).

* Awesome widgets: nice functions, like dynamic network speed (it checks for
  different interfaces), CPU speed, dynamic battery that will not show up if no battery is
  detected, and sound volume.

* Pacman functions: a lot of handy functions for the pacman package manager,
  like sorting by size, dependency listing, etc.

Generic Comments
****************

The only purpose is to be a source of inspiration. Examples are always a good
technical support. (Especially for applications that do not provide examples in
their documentation.)  There is no use in blind-copying the content of any file
into your personal home folder. At best it might break things.

In case you still want to copy some files -- for quick and dirty testing purpose
-- do not forget that most of the files are in hidden folders.  Also note that
in some shells, the '*' joker will NOT match hidden files, that is

    cp -r source-dir/* dest-dir/

will copy non-hidden folders only.  To match all folders, use the following
joker instead:

    cp -r source-dir/{.*,*} dest-dir/   # zsh
    cp -r source-dir/{.??*,*} dest-dir/ # bash

Still, the solution for bash is not perfect as it affects 3 characters files
only. A more convenient solution:

    # bash only.
    shopt -s dotglob
    cp -r source-dir/* dest-dir/

Git makes it possible to use your home folder as a git repo, thus versioning
all files directly. To fetch source from Git repo:

    cd
    git init
    git remote add origin <repo>
    git fetch
    git branch master origin/master
    git checkout master

Some applications will need extra dependencies other than the default ones. You
might have a look at the .pkg-* files to see what software I've been using.

Final word: do not forget to read the manpages!

Awesome
*******
Extra deps: Vicious (Linux only)

Configuration is very close to the default one, which mostly fits my needs.
Most of the work I've done is for the status bar, but since I'm using the
Vicious plugin, it is quite straightforward.

dwb
***
Some custom options, download location, search engines, etc.

Emacs
*****
Extra deps: emacs-lua-mode, emacs-mediawiki, emacs-yasnippet.

Emacs daemon is integrated flawlessly thanks to a small script. See homeinit.

Configuration for C programming. Bindings to compile either from makefile or
from a custom command if no makefile is found.

TeX and LaTeX full-featured home made environment: no AucTeX required, snippets,
dynamic compilation with various engines, dynamic configuration, proper PDF
view, temp files clean function, PDF compression, SyncTeX support.

Custom color theme with 256 colors.

Extended file support (shell files, Mutt mails, Arch Linux PKGBUILDs).

Some customization: columns, kill whole line, etc.

Some custom functions: duplicate line, unfill-paragraph, etc.

A lot of code snippets, especially for LaTeX. Contains document template, plot
generation, pie chart generation, and others.

Mutt
****
Compile options: IMAP and SMTP support.
Extra deps: antiword, ccrypt, fortune, sxiv, w3m.

This one is not easy to get into it. I managed to get multiple accounts with
encrypted passwords working, which means there is no plain password stored on
the disk. As a result, I just get prompted for a main password on Mutt startup,
then everything works out of the box.  I use ccrypt for password management
because it is much more simple than gnupg.

I'm using embedded IMAP and SMTP services which need appropriate compilation
options.

Some customization: custom index view, good Emacs integration (see .emacs),
custom theme (matches Emacs colors), various tweaks.

Thanks to the colorset.sh script, Mutt will check terminal color support and
load colors appropriately. Therefore this configuration should work on any
terminal, should it have 256-colors support or not.

URxvt has an URL support that works also for Mutt. For other terminals, you
might consider using the 'urlview' plugin for Mutt.

Ranger
******
Extra deps: antiword, atool, highlight, img2txt, mediainfo, odt2txt, pdftotext,
unrtf, w3m.

Custom bindings, file association, tweaked a few options.

Scripts
*******

homeinit: initialize a new home configuration, i.e. get needed files, create
           symlinks, etc.

netinit: network setup. Works with wpa_supplicant. May replace any network
          manager.

pkggen: generates lists of installed with pacman, FreeBSD's pkg and tlmgr (TeX
         Live manager).

Shell
*****
Target: zsh, bash

Probably the most interesting part here. A lot of stuff: aliases, functions,
shell options, etc.

Please note that this config is mainly intended -- and tested -- for zsh. It
should be mostly compatible with Bourne shell though.  When incompabilities have
been encountered, it has been reported into the configuration files. Hence the
shared folder .shell.d/, whose files get sourced by both bash and zsh.
Bash-specific and zsh-specific options are in dedicated files ending with the
appropriate shell name.

TeX
***

plainTeX macros, most importantly a partial UTF-8 support (taken from LaTeX).

A lot of LaTeX macros. Among others: pie charts, dynamic plots with
input file and trend.

plainTeX macros are in the '.texmf' folder. LaTeX macros are all bundled into
Emacs snippets so that .tex documents do not rely on any external file.

URxvt
*****
Extra deps: Muennich's perl extensions (keyboard-select, clipboard, url-matcher)

Custom font and colors, no scroll bar, url-matcher, clipboard, and
keyboard-select.

Vim
***
I've only been a casual Vim user, so do not expect too much from it.

################################################################################
Known issues
************

Emacs: some colors do not work as intended. MediaWiki fails to upload pages
after some idle time.

URxvt: using the paste function from Muennich's clipboard on the same terminal
where text was copied will make xsel crash.
