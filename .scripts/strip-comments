## Default to C block comments. You can change the comment delimiters from
## command line. The delims are regexes. For instance call this script with
##
##   awk -v begin="#" -v end="$" -f <this-script> <files>
##
## to use shell comment delimiters.

BEGIN {
	## Since 'begin' and 'end' are regexes, we need to escape some sequences.
	if(begin == "")
		begin="/\\*"
	if(end == "")
		end="\\*/"
}

	while (match ($0, begin)) {
		before = substr ($0, 1, RSTART-1)
		$0 = substr($0, RSTART)
		printf("%s", before)

		## Reach line where first 'end' is found.
		while (! match($0, end) )
			getline
