## Default to C block comments. You can change the comment delimiters from
## command line. The delims are regexes. For instance call this script with
##
##   awk -v begin="#" -v end="$" -f <this-script> <files>
##
## to use shell comment delimiters.

BEGIN {
    ## Since 'begin' and 'end' are regexes, we need to escape some sequences.
    if(begin == "")
        begin="/\\*"
    if(end == "")
        end="\\*/"
}

        before = substr ($0, 1, RSTART-1)
        $0 = substr($0, RSTART)
        printf("%s", before)

        ## Reach line where first 'end' is found.
        while (! match($0, end) )
            getline
