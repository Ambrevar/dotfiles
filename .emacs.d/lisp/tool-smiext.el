  "Indentation of sequences of simple expressions without intervening keywords or operators.
E.g. 'a b c' or `g (balbla) f'. Can be a list of expressions or a
function call. If it's a function call, the first element is
special (it's the function). We distinguish function calls from
mere lists of expressions based on whether the preceding token is
listed in the `list-intro' entry of smie-indent-rules.

Overload original `smie-indent-exps': make alignment customizable
in `smie-align'."

  ;; to add similar indentation hooks for particular positions, but
