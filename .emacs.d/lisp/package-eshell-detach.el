;;; eshell-detach.el

;; Instead of sending the command prompt to Eshell, send it to a bash shell run in a dtach session.
;; dtach allows the user to disconnect (quit Eshell or even Emacs) while the command keeps going.
;; Stderr and stdout can be both displayed on screen and redirected to a file thanks to the `tee' program.

;; dtach allows the commandline (that is, bash) to run in the background.
;; bash allows for:
;; - pausing the execution of the program;
;; - executing pipe lines (e.g. grep foo | sed ... | cut | wc).  dtach cannot do that alone.
;;
;; Bash is necessary here because if we want to run Eshell within dtach, we need to run Emacs in --batch mode.
;;   emacs --batch --eval '(progn (eshell) (insert "echo hello") (eshell-send-input))'
;; Issues: --batch sends to stderr.  How do we redirect the output to the real stdout/stderr?

;;; TODO: Remove bash / tee / dtach dependencies.
;;; See if `make-process' is the way to go: it supports stderr/stdout separation and stop/cont.
;;; Re-use `eshell-gather-process-output'?  Re-implement?
