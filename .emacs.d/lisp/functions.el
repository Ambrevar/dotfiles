;;; Functions

;;; Notes on mark and region: to get a consistent behaviour regardless of
;;; Transient mode, check `(use-region-p)'. It will work as expected if
;;; transient. If not, it will always be true as soon as the mark has been set
;;; once; so you need to make sure the mark is set as you want beforehand (e.g.
;;; whole buffer, single line...). This is the behaviour of `sort-lines'.
;;;
;;; The clean way to get static region boundaries and fallback on buffer boundaries:
;;
;; (let (start end)
;;   (if (use-region-p)
;;       (setq start (region-beginning) end (region-end))
;;     (setq start (point-min) end (point-max)))
;;
;;; If several commands act on region and the region size/pos is susceptible to change:
;;
;; (let ((start (set-marker (make-marker) (if (use-region-p) (region-beginning) (point-min))))
;;       (end (set-marker (make-marker) (if (use-region-p) (region-end) (point-end)))))
;;
;;; For commands that only work on regions:
;;
;; (defun count-lines-region (start end)
;;   "Print number of lines and characters in the region."
