# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, add this line to your options.py
# so it is not loaded twice:
#
#     load_default_rc = False
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings.  For
# changing settings or running more complex python code, use the
# configuation file "options.py" or define commands in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
